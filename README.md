## Welcome
Welcome to the Video Motion Tracker of tech.joelbecker.net! I hope you find this software useful, fun, interesting, or all of those.

This is free software, under the terms of the GNU General Public License. (See the accompanying LICENSE.TXT.)


## Running
The executable jar is located in the bin folder. Two command-line scripts provide templates for running the motion tracking program with both a video file input, and web-cam input. (Both are specified as a URL on the command line.)


## Source Code
The source code is organized into Eclipse Java projects, under the eclipse_projects folder. Within each project is a "src" folder where the actual Java code resides. Using the Eclipse Java IDE is recommended (http://eclipse.org).


## Installation
This project is organized into a set of Eclipse projects. To use them:


### Creating an Eclipse Workspace
* If you don't already have Eclipse installed, download and install Eclipse Java IDE (http://eclipse.org)
* Right click in the "Package Explorer" view to the left, and select "Import..." from the pop-up menu.
* In the dialog, expand General, and select "Existing projects into workspace". Click "Next"
* Next to "Select root directory:" click the "Browse" button and select the eclipse_projects folder of this project.
* Make sure all of the projects are selected, then click "Finish".

Now you have an Eclipse workspace containing the projects.
